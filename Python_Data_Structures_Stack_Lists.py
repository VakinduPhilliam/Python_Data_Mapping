# Python Data Structures Stack Lists.
# The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, 
# where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). 
# To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). 
# To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index.

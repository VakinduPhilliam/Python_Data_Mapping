# Python Data Structure Dictionaries
# Unlike sequences (Lists, Strings etc.), which are indexed by a range of numbers, 
# dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; 
# strings and numbers can always be keys.
# The dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs:

phone_Numbers = dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])   #Displays {'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}
phone_Numbers

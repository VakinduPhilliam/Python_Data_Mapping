# Python Data Structures List Comprehensions
# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. 

vec = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]

# create a new list with the values doubled

[x*2 for x in vec]

# filter the list to exclude negative numbers

[x for x in vec if x >= 0]

# apply a function to all the elements

[abs(x) for x in vec]

# call a method on each element

freshfruit = ['  banana', '  loganberry ', 'passion fruit  ']

[weapon.strip() for weapon in freshfruit]

# create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square)

[(x, x**2) for x in range(6)]

# the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised
# flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for'

vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
[num for elem in vec for num in elem]
